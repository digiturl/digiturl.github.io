I am currently a PHD student in the <a href="https://infrastructure.eng.unimelb.edu.au/">Department of Infrastructure Engineering</a> , Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Melbourne.

I am using computer vision, machine learning to quantify infrastructures and map them with air pollutants or GHG emissions, in an effort to tackle the urgent climate crisis with all interested parties.

Open to job opportunities in academia or industry from Feb 2025. One-page CV is <a href='https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:AP:a0ce3bfc-b227-4679-a802-1ed7637e375b'>here</a>.
